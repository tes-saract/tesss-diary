      <title>I find another book written before the 1960s and shock myself by enjoying it</title>

      <description>Every time I read a book written before like the 1960s I am kind of always surprised by how funny they are and that probably says a lot about me as a person. Especially this and Emma (by Jane Austen) are both some of the funniest books I have read in such a long time that at this point I probably shouldn&#39;t be shocked. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a huge number of particularly deep or analyticaly thoughts about the book, but it was hilariously and beautifully written - I adored the four main characters who were all deeply interesting and unique, especially of these Lotte and Lady Charlotte were probably my two favourite characters in the text.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Each day I live as if I am already dead, and I tell you what I would like for you to do. When I am dead - I say it that way because of the things I know, I do not expect to live long enough to read this book in its finished form - I want you to watch and see if I&amp;rsquo;m not right in what I say: that the white man, in his press, is going to identify me with &amp;lsquo;hate&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>&#39;A Magical Girl Retires&#39; as a Reformation of the Magical Girl Genre</title>

      <description>To anyone thinking if they should read this (I vote yes), go read the synopsis, it perfectly conveys the what and why of reading this. In fact, if you want you could put this down (my writing is a lot worse than Seolyeon&amp;rsquo;s, and Anton Hur&amp;rsquo;s translation) and go finish the book first - it&amp;rsquo;s quite short.&#xA;A brief note, I&amp;rsquo;m not the most into the magical girl genre as a whole really, I&amp;rsquo;d probably consider myself more involved than like an average person but considering I write a bit here about the genre&amp;rsquo;s history I want to preface that I might be off on some of these points.</description>

      <description>Just full spoilers in this one, it&amp;rsquo;s too hard to talk about the world without them. This is also a book that my thoughts about will definitely likely change once the sequel comes out - there was a lot of time spent on worldbuilding, mystery, and characterisation that was done really interestingly but didn&amp;rsquo;t pay out in this book and I&amp;rsquo;m not yet certain if I enjoyed that fully or not.</description>

      <description>One of many queer romance novels I&amp;rsquo;ve read recently, but the one I felt like writing about, The Goode Governor (awful name aside like come on) actually surprised me a lot. Centrally in portraying two highly intelligent and motivated queer women which is something that really I don&amp;rsquo;t see much in any romance novels. Reflecting on this, it feels like a lot of the time there is one smart/motivated character in the couple and the other it there to play a foil to them.</description>

      <description>Being completely upfront here this is not going to be the most detailed reflection on Wittig&amp;rsquo;s essays, it took me a bit to finish this whole collection and I didn&amp;rsquo;t think to make notes or start this diary until I was a few months past finishing the earlier ones. Unfortunately, as well, the later essays in the collection did lose me somewhat as they begin to discuss a lot more of the literary craft and specifically with reference to some other authors at the time as well as Wittig&amp;rsquo;s own work in a way that I just did not have the background to understand.</description>

      <title>Here Comes the Sun; Internalised homophobia, rural culture and the environment in Sunburn</title>

      <description>The third book which I&amp;rsquo;ve rated 10/10 with sun in its title (see: She Who Became the Sun, Klara and the Sun); Sunburn is a heart wrenching exploration of childhood and early adulthood in a deeply traditional, rural Irish upbringing. There is so much to talk about from this book and I adored it deeply, but something about it just made me really want to write about the way it uses the environment.</description>
