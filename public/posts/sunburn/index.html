    <p>From start to finish, the environment in <a href="https://www.chloemichellehowarth.com">Sunburn</a> is perhaps more of an expression and representation of Lucy&rsquo;s feelings and emotions than anything else we see from her. And this is not to say that we do not get a deep exploration of her thoughts and feelings throughout the text, but rather that the imagery of her rural environment, especially the titular sun, is so importantly <em>a part of</em> her thoughts and feelings that it is impossible to separate the two.</p>
<p>From the first page, as the narrator, she herself relies on this imagery and the parallels between the environment and society of Crossmore - &ldquo;Life in the Summer goes slow, like one long, drawn-out fade of the sun. Doesn&rsquo;t every day in Crossmore feel that way, at this tricky age?&rdquo; - to even describe opening stretch of her story. Throughout this is such a central part of Lucy&rsquo;s narration, and conveys her emotions so beautifully.</p>
<p>When she states &ldquo;I feel as though I am an island, apart from everybody else&rdquo; early in the book, and though this theme is discussed more, I feel it is almost already clear from the beginning how her ties to the physicality of Crossmore (at the least) prevent her from ever being isolated from her community - for better or worse. Also kick rocks John Donne I think this is a muchhhh more interesting exploration of the concept.</p>
<p>Side note here, &ldquo;Now is the time between birth and slaughter. Another Summer has arrived.&rdquo; is suchhhh a good opening line, and really perfectly sets the tone for the book. And further the way this book conceives about death even when not talking about it directly (e.g. &ldquo;I love you, I love you, I love you, in this life and the next and the last&rdquo;, and the above quote) feels very queer in a way that is probably very tragic if I think about it too hard.</p>
<p>Other characters, too, weave this rural landscape so tightly into their identities that it feels inescapable but for Lucy to do the same, in a way that drives a lot of the central conflict of the text - the line between Lucy&rsquo;s ties to Crossmore and her queer identity. In the third chapter (~1/10th through the book, they&rsquo;re quite short), her mother comments on the heritage of the family&rsquo;s supposedly cursed farmland &ldquo;&lsquo;How could any woman make rocks come up out of the earth?&rsquo; &hellip; she quickly blesses herself.&rdquo; While it is perfectly normal for Lucy&rsquo;s father to share this story &ldquo;every Christmas Eve&rdquo;, reflection on an independent and powerful woman - one who was able to uproot the very environment of Crossmore and its society - is tantamount to blasphemy for Lucy&rsquo;s mother. Indeed &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t believe in it, but she is afraid of it&rdquo;; regardless of whether it is impossible, simply reflecting and wondering on such a possibility is sacreligious, a thought with obvious parallels to Lucy&rsquo;s realisations about her identity.</p>
<p>The text does such an amazingly beautiful job of reflecting on queer existence in rural communities, and this shackles-tight tie between the landscape and society is one of, I think, the most effective and beautiful ways it does so. Huge respect to Howarth, who has managed to combine the most gorgeous prose I have read in some time with deeply impactful themes of identity and community. I could just read this for ages on how well done it is, to the point that in writing this I had to stop myself a few times from getting carried away and just re-reading it.</p>
<p>It is such a wonderful book with so many other beautiful qualities I didn&rsquo;t have as much to write on but were just as good. To one quick note, for as many books as I have read featuring a queer relationship where one or both characters do not feel comfortable coming out I do not think any have handled the internal conflict as well or as interestingly as Lucy&rsquo;s. Last Night at the Telegraph Club possibly comes close, but the presence of Susannah as such a vibrant counterpart and foil to Lucy is such a wonderful strength of this book I think it does it better (not to put down LNatTC, just different).</p>
<p>As a whole this book is foremost some of the most beautiful prose I&rsquo;ve read in a bit, whilst also delving into such touching themes of queer identity. Absolutely, absolutely, worth a read and one of my favourites of the year so far.</p>

Throughout the text, as the ways in which Crossmore society has sunk its teeth into Lucy become more clear, so to does she come to rely on the environment for peace, solitude, and crucially to understand herself. The environment begins to represent an escape for her from the pressures of human society in Crossmore, but crucially it cannot represent a permanent one. The environment is as much a part of the societal landscape of Crossmore as Lucy is herself and she thus finds herself eventually returned to the same problems she previously faced. As her relationship with Susannah begins as well more in earnest the two of them similarly find safety in the rural landscape but only temporarily, as the seasons change and they grow they are, centrally Lucy is, forced into a position of answering questions of identity and what is desired from their future - outside Crossmore or within. At the end of her time in high school, as Lucy wastes away in the cracks between the decisions of leaving with Susannah or with Martin, she reflects how she &ldquo;ignore[s] the Autumn and the questions and reality. And for a short while, [her] life is an endless Summer night.&rdquo; Again metaphor, imagery, Howarth really is an amazing writer of prose and I am definitely looking forwards to more from her.</p>
<p>At the very very end of the book, Lucy goes to deliver a final letter to Susannah&rsquo;s old address. &ldquo;Before I&rsquo;m off the porch, the door opens. And here is Susannah, a flame in the doorway. I am winded … I have to squint to see her.&rdquo; (Side note please I have to believe they end up together after this scene, I don&rsquo;t know if I am emotionally capable of handling any other outcome it&rsquo;s canon to me. It make so much sense but was so rude of Howarth to end the story here). The parataxis in their brief conversation alongside this imagery so perfectly encompasses the weight of emotional truth that Lucy came to realise throughout the last act of the book - she cannot be anyone but herself, cannot exist as anything but a lesbian - but where before she realises these facts intellectually, as in &ldquo;I was born perfect, and every step I took brought me further from that. Now every day I am closer to being that girl again.&rdquo;, it is only once she finds the physical space in which to embody this identity - the presence of Susannah in the previous quote - that she can truly live such a life.</p>
<p>What was wanting and believing becomes knowing and feeling purely on the arrival of Susannah and with her the sun. Indeed throughout the chapters leading to the final, with Lucy and Martin living in the city, the Sun is only discussed (as far as I can find) with reference to Susannah. In this final chapter, indeed, it does not appear at all until she does. As Susannah says to Lucy as the final line of the book - &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re back.&rsquo;&rdquo; Only through Susannah, and thus centrally through truly embracing her queer identity, Lucy is able to reconstruct the environment for herself in complete freedom.</p>
<p>Also note the quote &ldquo;My sweet wasteland [Crossmore], all you ever really did was hold me back.&rdquo;, from this final chapter too. For all that Crossmore was physically to Lucy throughout the book, in finding herself and embracing her identity she sees it now as desolate - Susannah is the sun. (Indeed the book all but says so many times over, even as she is first introduced as &quot; Susannah, beautiful sunbeam Susannah&quot;)</p>
<p>At this point I could probably write about the book forever, and have come back to add to this a few times lol, but I want to add two final related points on this overarching idea. First is the nature of Susannah and Lucy as foils, there is so much duality to their experiences throughout the book that ties into so many of the themes including those I haven&rsquo;t discussed here (class, family, friendship through many lenses), but specifically for every bit that Lucy reflects on Susannah&rsquo;s beauty she feels at the least uncomfortable with herself for recognising these things, her internalised homophobia leading her to rely instead of visceral, bodily imagery, in reflecting on herself and queer desire which lies in stark contrast to Susannah&rsquo;s beauty which she literally and metaphorically sees as a fact of nature. This is especially prevalent throughout the early sections of the book before Lucy is really able to confront her internalised feelings (does she ever really? maybe not).</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her spit in my mouth. It&rsquo;s her racing through my mind. I don&rsquo;t mind it. It makes me sick. I like it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all wounds, Susannah, and you are the loveliest pus. Flooding in to heal me. Yellow as the sun.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;She is fresh air, and warmth, and mornings in July. What is there to fix? There is evil in my yearning, I know, I just can&rsquo;t see where yet&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>These lines are especially important as they exist before she begins to understand herself as a lesbian at which point her desire clarifies; when they first kiss Lucy reflects &ldquo;At last, I am defined&rdquo;. Obviously a lot to discuss here about queer representation, especially in a rural environment, etc. Back to the point, the imagery of Lucy&rsquo;s narration so clearly reflects her internalised homophobia; Susannah is metaphorically represented as pus only in the context of Lucy&rsquo;s desire for her and Lucy&rsquo;s internal &ldquo;injury&rdquo;, but still remains the sun at the same time.</p>
<p>The other major point is how this exploration of the environment exists in conversation with other queer storytelling. I might write something about it at some point, but there&rsquo;s definitely something really interesting about the way Crossmore&rsquo;s rural environment impacts Lucy&rsquo;s life which separates it from other queer coming of age texts. Possibly once I re-read a few (I&rsquo;m centrally thinking of Last Night at the Telegraph Club and Stone Butch Blues) I&rsquo;ll have more clear ideas but basically, hey they all live and embody physically different spaces across the texts - and I think that as well as influencing the storytelling also crucially impacts they way they view their queer identity.</p>
<p>If Lily (NLatTC) had the physical space of a rural environment wherein Lucy finds so much solace by herself and also to exist with Susannah, e.g. where their first kiss is far from town after a hike, what would her relationship to the telegraph club and the secrecy that it inherently requires look like? Likely very different. There&rsquo;s probably also space for analysis of how a lot of their other themes intersect and also I think really interestingly the ways in which their worlds respond to their identities as queer characters but also from a more intersectional perspective (there are reasons that Lucy does not have to fear the Gardia, while Lily (LNatTC) and Jess (SBB) do fear the police, which I think would be deeply interesting to explore).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much to write about the passages of Susannah&rsquo;s depression post-high school but pre-timeskip, but wow they are so tragic and amazingly written. Just a shout out to them for making me feel way too many emotions really. Similarly, Lucy and Susannah&rsquo;s reconnection over letters is sooooo beautiful and had me almost crying on a very crowded bus (I then did cry over the last few chapters, but I was on a less crowded bus then).</p>
<p>As a conclusion to my ramblings, read it I guess? Even apart from this there is so much more to the book I could probably reflect on it forever. 10/10</p>
