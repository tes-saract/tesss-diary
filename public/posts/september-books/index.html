<p>by <a href="https://chanaporter.com">Chana Porter</a> — 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗:</p>
<p>The Seep was an incredibly novel, insightful, and crucially empathetic vision of an &ldquo;alien invasion&rdquo;, and through this novum so many aspects of life and loss. After the main character, Trina FastHorse Goldberg-Oneka&rsquo;s, wife Deeba decides that she wishes to be reborn as a child (and Trina declines to raise her), the book follows her as she journeys on an &ldquo;unexpected quest&rdquo; to try rescue a lost boy. Most interestingly to me here was really her personal journey, as the introduction of the Seep and through it a post-scarcity, post-colonial, and generally utopian society reshapes so much of how Trina is able to think about loss, and also react to loss. In a world so invested in her mental health, she finds herself unable to enact some of the (temporarily or permanently) self-destructive tendencies that she wants to turn to or find any solid point of emotional reference through which to work through her grief - examining in turn the ways in which we grieve and what a healthy process of grief actually looks like (As well as what loss really means, in a situation where Trina did choose to completely separate herself from Deeba despite Deeba&rsquo;s massive life change). This personal journey, especially her grief in the early chapters and then her development and catharsis in the final chapters, are incredibly touching, and I was feeling so much for Trina the whole way through.</p>
<p>Some of the other components of the plot, being the missing boy and her conflict with Horizon Line, were a little bit weaker but I don&rsquo;t think I didn&rsquo;t enjoy them or find them valuable so much as I didn&rsquo;t find them as emotionally compelling. At the same time, however, the worldbuilding is very well down, with all of the other side characters who are introduced doing a really good job of fleshing out this utopia and showing the diversity of what life in such a world would be like. For all that Trina struggles - and her struggles highlight genuine shortcomings of the Seep and its emotional immaturity - it overall does seem like a nice existence, and this depth within the consideration of such a utopian vision in a way that ultimately resolves to see how we can fix things rather than trying to tear down the whole utopia or show it to be a dystopia somehow was really nice to read. If I ever got the chance to vote for Porter as supreme ruler of the world I would definitely do so.</p>
<p>It was also really nice to see trans representation, and especially in a sense where Trina&rsquo;s gender identity plays an important part in exploring the book&rsquo;s themes but the themes themselves aren&rsquo;t inherently trans - that was cool to see and really makes me wish we saw more trans characters in media. The book itself was quite a short read (~100 pages on my kobo) and I got through it in an evening which was really nice, and it was also just really entertainingly written - definitely recommended.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tehlorkay/?hl=en">Tehlor Kay Mejia</a> — 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕:</p>
<p>Oh my god this book was so good - the best romance novel I have read this year and possibly my proper favourite (It&rsquo;s been a while since I read some others that would be in contention here). The very brief intro of it is that Cash Delgado, small-town bartender, single parent to six-year-old Parker (who is such a good character), and supposedly straight woman, keeps having &ldquo;<em>intimate</em>&rdquo; dreams about her best friend Inez and doesn&rsquo;t know what to do about it. But from this (which is a fun premise) the book builds such an amazing conflux of touching emotions throughout all of the aspects of Cash&rsquo;s life and the world around her that makes all of the characters feel really wonderfully fleshed out, and through it returns to make the emotional payoff of the romantic tension throughout the book so much more amazing.</p>
<p>Every part of the major plot of the book, as Cash tries to raise enough money and trust in herself (internally and from the community) to expand/develop Joyce&rsquo;s Bar where she works so that it can contest the expansion of the city-slicker gentrified bar chain Kings into Ridley Falls, builds such a vibrant sense of community and I really fell in love with every part of Ridley Falls and the characters we saw within throughout it (though with an exception to the homophobic ones briefly mentioned<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>). This is especially true within Inez&rsquo;s friend group who become somewhat of a found family for Cash and Parker, and the depth of queer representation and diversity in life experiences across this group is really wonderfully written and gives a lot to the book (I love trans authors &lt;3).</p>
<p>Alongside this I really really loved Parker&rsquo;s character, and aside for being really fun to read individually her relationships with Inez and Cash in parental roles brings so much to all three of their characters; One of the things I really loved about this book overall, really, is just how much fun and inspiring it is - it&rsquo;s something I really love about the genre as a whole - and this relationship is a big part of this. This is probably going to be my go-to romance recommendation for a while and I am possibly going to check out Mejia&rsquo;s earlier romance novel Sammy Espinoza&rsquo;s Last Review.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I think of Isabella P.&rsquo;s mom calling these people heathens as she teaches her own child bigotry. In that moment, I realize I&rsquo;d rather be mistaken for this kind of heathen than her kind.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Meandering. Letting the sun warm out shoulders. This is my favourite season, I think, as the breeze blows the smell of Inez&rsquo;s chamomile-and-rose shampoo across my face. Late spring. Nearly summer. When everything is being reborn.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ndinn/?hl=en">Natalie Diaz</a> — 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗:</p>
<p>I actually started this collection of poems back in July (the 20th to be precise), and so this has taken me longer to read than almost anything else I touched this year. But honestly that is because a lot of these poems sat a lot more heavily in my thoughts than a lot of the things I did read - a lot of the poems I read through multiple times and spent a lot of thought on them. For a book that my kobo suggests will take 41 minutes to read I spent more than 4 hours actively reading it, and spent an indeterminant amount of extra time just thinking about it or researching the language and references inside.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can do the collection as a whole justice on a short review like this one, and I am thinking about writing a bit about some my favourite poems from the collection. In place of this for now, I am going to recommend reading <a href="https://emergencemagazine.org/poem/the-first-water-is-the-body/">The First Water is the Body</a> and <a href="https://www.nativeartsandcultures.org/natalie-diaz">Top Ten Reasons Why Indians Are Good at Basketball</a>, and then include a lot of quotes because there were too many I loved.</p>

<p>Not great, but also the kind of thing that I sometimes like to read to keep my reading momentum going. I honestly don&rsquo;t remember much of it writing this now at the end of the month; for as much as I wanted to keep up with writing these as I read the books I kinda failed miserably in that regard and had to write in retrospect. I think a lot of the miscommunication that the main plot relied on wasn&rsquo;t great but eh. A fine romance read but there are a lot better if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for (see one &lsquo;Cash Delgado Is Living The Dream&rsquo;, for example).</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t take any annotations, though it was also like 2am when I read this book iirc.</p>

<p>by Sylvia Plath — 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌘:</p>
<p>I probably don&rsquo;t have a huge amount to add to the discussion of this book, but yes, it is absolutely a classic of American (British? Western? she wrote it in Britain I guess) fiction. The way in which Plath explores life envisioned through the titular &lsquo;bell jar&rsquo; is so vivid and current, even with changes in context, and really crucially makes me tragically wish we could see more of her work in novel form. Especially as while her skill as a poet translates to vividly into many of the individual passages, the book in no way rests on these and she is at least to me just as skilled as a novel writer. The copy I read had a note at the end that she was writing another book exploring  perceptions of life, and her life (I think), outside of the distorted view of &rsquo;the bell jar&rsquo; - and considering her as an author I wish so so much that she was able to continue her work and finish this amongst others.</p>
<p>The other major thing that really stuck out to me within this book as well though is that wow Plath was really racist - this is something I knew like a bit more generally from studying her in high school and learning about her since, but the scene in this book where she goes out of her way to assault a black man because he served her (and everyone else at the institution she was in) too many bean-based dishes in one dinner was insane. It was so out of place (excepting the context of Plath&rsquo;s racism) and really just felt vindictive from a character sense. When you consider the other comments made throughout the book though, e.g. her comment on Chinese people&rsquo;s skin colour on like page 7, it does paint a bit of a picture of her personal views.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>It occurred to me that my vision of the fig tree and all the fat figs that withered and fell to earth might well have arisen from the profound void of an empty stomach.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>A really touching series of short stories that explores so many interesting and valuable perspectives. I actually don&rsquo;t have a huge amount to write about in respect to this, I think possibly based on the breadth of topics it&rsquo;s hard for me to write a summary but also too much to go into individually, but it was really good. Dear Sister, How to Make Love to a Physicist, and Snowfall were some favourites of mine.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://www.elizaclarkauthor.com">Eliza Clark</a> — 🌕🌕🌕🌘🌑:</p>
<p>I actually had really high hopes for Penance, and was really disappointed by what I ended up getting out of the book. A lot of this, however, I think is more of a product of me myself and not the book or Clark&rsquo;s writing - specifically in the fact that I am really not a huge fan of true crime as a genre, and apart from the ethical considerations which I picked up this book due to my interest in I also am just not hugely interested in it.</p>
<p>The book is supposedly a re-published copy of a book written within the world of Penance about the violent death of school student Joan Wilson at the hands of other students in her grade, re-published specifically because, as the intro explains, the first edition of the book was pulled from shelves after those interviewed within came forwards and accused the in-universe author, Carelli, of fabricating content and also illegally acquiring some of the information used within it. The book, then, was released again after some briefly mentioned court case, with only the names of those not directly involved changed as the in-universe publishers believe that &ldquo;writers (even writers of non-fiction) have a right to express themselves and tell stories in the manner they feel best fits the story in question.&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>This initial premise sets up a really interesting question about authorial discretion, but also crucially the way in which we engage with true crime media and as the book goes further to explore, whether we should engage with it at all. Unfortunately, in the transition from this introduction chapter to then the story as written by Carelli I really failed to engage with the narrative he was writing and to my disappointment this did take up the vast majority of the book. I think, going back to my first paragraph, being someone who doesn&rsquo;t engage much with true crime I was not really ready to engage with this component of the story so much, and I spent a lot of the time just wondering whether we were going to see more of a direct exploration of the ethics of Carelli&rsquo;s book instead of the true crime that effectively becomes the main plot. There is some discussion of Carelli&rsquo;s role in a later part of the book, from an external viewpoint, but it&rsquo;s really not much and unfortunately I was left reading a true crime piece which whilst very well written just didn&rsquo;t appeal to me very much.</p>
<p>As much as I did not connect with the main story I did feel myself sympathising a lot with the side characters, and also really just wondering what their lives were really like in the aftermath but also just through to their futures - and I think this is a testament to Clark&rsquo;s writing how fleshed out they all feel and how much of their reality you can kind of feel behind Carelli&rsquo;s authorial viewpoint, but also then you do have to wonder how much of that was &ldquo;made up&rdquo; by him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>There&rsquo;d be no escaping them now, the true-crime people. People like me, really.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>by Leo Tolstoy, translated by Constance Garnett — ???:</p>
<p>Up until this point I haven&rsquo;t been writing about the books I start but don&rsquo;t finish within a month, and just waiting till I do finish them to write something - but Anna Karenina kind of ruined the trajectory of my reading for the rest of the month and I am still only about 75% of the way through at the time of writing this (having started on the 11th of Sep, and it is now the 1st of Oct) so I thought I would give some thoughts.</p>
<p>Briefly, (as I will write more once I finish), this book is quite good and I can absolutely see why it is such a classic - but central to this in a positive and negative sense is that it is very much a product of its time. Tolstoy&rsquo;s writing style really wonderfully weaves through so many aspects of life in late 19th-century Russia into the goings on of the book in a way that I really haven&rsquo;t felt in any other author I&rsquo;ve read. For someone living so disconnected from this time, the intricacies of the political systems at the time, the structure of aristocratic life in relation to the land around them and the &ldquo;peasants&rdquo; who were hired to work that land, and the religious underpinning of the Russian Orthodoxy throughout life at the time are kind of just some of the broader concepts which I now know so much more than I ever thought I would know about the time just from this piece - and from where I have looked to validate some of the things I have read it does seem very accurate. At the same time, though, these pieces never feel out of place, or drag, or really overstay their welcome which is insanely impressive for a book with 350,000+ words, and I am continually happy as I read to keep reading chapter after chapter of Levin trying to figure out how to best run his farm, or about Vronsky squirrelling himself away for a day to sort out his debts.</p>
<p>The counterpoint to this, however, is that a lot of the broader politics <strong>of</strong> the book are just a bit boring to be reading now. I won&rsquo;t go into huge detail before I finish reading it, but aspects of how Anna&rsquo;s infidelity is viewed especially (being one of the major plot points of the whole book) really say a lot about society&rsquo;s views on women at the time in a way that really isn&rsquo;t great to read. The characters themselves in this sense are mostly well written, and I think(?) Tolstoy is giving her some leeway for the time - but really there are quite a few moments when it just feels a bit tired/played out.</p>
<p>I especially felt this in the way that Anna&rsquo;s relationship with her son is discussed compared to Alexei, but also in the general sense in how Anna&rsquo;s life is explored compared to a lot of the male characters. While Levin has a whole plotline of his own love life, we also see a lot about his interest in his land, in farming, etc; While Vronsky feels a lot of the direct effects of his affair with Anna, we also see components like his participation in district elections, his passion for horse racing, and the interactions he has with the soldiers he worked with through his career. Anna really gets none of this, there are some brief mentions of her reading a lot in her free time towards the last 1/3 of the book but this is kind of only used to explore her relationship with Vronsky at the time. Just a bit disappointing but also I probably should have expected that going in.</p>
<p>Also wow he really just wrote fanfiction of himself and his wife in Levin and Kitty based on the number of footnotes in the edition that I read discussing how stories from their relations are taken from his own life.</p>
<p>While I continued to read this, and with general busyness within my own life for a number of other reasons, I didn&rsquo;t really have the energy to read anything else too heavy so most of the rest of the books I read this month were quite light reads that I mostly read over like a day or two each when I needed a break from Anna Karenina.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rawniesabor/">Rawnie Sabor</a> — 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌘:</p>
<p>A short sequel to Kiss of Seduction and side-novel in the Court of Chains series, this was surprisingly really really good (and I can firmly say I get monster romance now lol). Often these kind of side-stories/small sequels to romance novels are weaker than the original, with smaller stakes or just containing a few cute moments. but Kiss of Love really explored the development of Evie and Natalya&rsquo;s relationship in a way that was really compelling and felt quite real. Evie went through a lot in Kiss of Seduction, and to see the longer-lasting effects of trauma addressed in a mature way was lovely - to see her healing across Kiss of Seduction and Kiss of Love as a whole was just amazing.</p>
<p>Something that has crossed my mind thinking about A Little Sin, the book I read after, is how the insta-love in this and Kiss of Seduction played out, there was that immediate sense of kind of love, definitely attraction, for each other but the way in which their own histories and experiences then shaped how Evie and Natalya each approached the relationship from that point onwards was really well done. The conflicts that do arise around their relationship make so much sense given both of their personal histories and I think like an additional point to my brief review of that book last month is that I never felt like any parts of the relationship drama were unnecessary at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>It wasn&rsquo;t until that moment Natalya realized just how much not knowing had affected [Evie]. How big this missing part of her life really was. How much of what she&rsquo;d lost she still sought to regain.<br>
There were things Natalya could never give her, no matter how much she tried, and the thought would have been agonizing beyond comprehension if Evie hadn&rsquo;t thrown her arms around Natalya, hugged her tightly, and started laughing.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rawniesabor/">Rawnie Sabor</a> — 🌕🌕🌕🌖🌑:</p>
<p>Compared to Kiss of Seduction and Kiss of Love, A Little Sin had a kind of massive vibe of &ldquo;people sleeping together as an alternative to going to therapy&rdquo;. Luckily, as someone who reads romance books rather than going to therapy too this was right up my alley<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Violet and Reyna&rsquo;s relationship is really interesting compared to Evie and Natalya from the previous book, and I really enjoyed the way that their dynamic almost immediately clicked but without either of them (especially Violet) really realising what she fully wanted out of it, e.g. the romance bit. It made it all very fun to read with good character work and interactions that didn&rsquo;t have the downside of insta-love tropes sometimes despite really kind of being that?</p>
<p>Violet&rsquo;s relationship with her sister Blake and her parents was really compelling, and some of the moments (especially with her mum trying to set her up with &ldquo;suitable men&rdquo;) The plot towards the end of the book became a bit obvious and some of the drama that arose was just a bit annoying to read, but I really hope we get another side story like Kiss of Love for these two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>&lsquo;it just felt&hellip; relieving,&rsquo; Violet said with a sigh. &lsquo;Like I wasn&rsquo;t hiding. Or pretending to be someone I wasn&rsquo;t. And no one cared. And even if they did, what they thought didn&rsquo;t matter.&rsquo;</em>&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="the-dominion-series">The Dominion Series</h2>
<p>by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thejjarias/?hl=en">J. J. Arias</a> — 🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑:</p>
<p>Something about Arias&rsquo; writing has made her an author I kind of turn straight to when I&rsquo;m looking for just easy romance reads, and after a week of just reading through Anna Karenina without reading anything else I kind of needed that and so I binged this whole series oops. One thing I do think about every time I see one of her books, which all (at least afaik) feature Cuban American main characters, is that I really don&rsquo;t know much about the history of Cuban refugees or a huge amount beyond the broad strokes of America&rsquo;s blockade of the country - if there is a book on my read list some time this year about Cuban history then Arias&rsquo;s works are probably the reason why.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/71a455ba-2d8e-40df-8c9f-435b09dd1488">Losing Control</a> was really fun, and I especially loved Roxy&rsquo;s character and the ways we see her trying to branch out from her identity as a popstar within her relationship with Adriana (primarily in her vulnerability and the development of their emotional intimacy) and also kind of parallel to this, within the ways in which she grows as an artist throughout the book. The chemistry between the two was also really fun to read.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/8d66546a-e750-4518-b9f5-80f43b4bfc2f">Fighting for Control</a> was similarly good, enemies-to-lovers is always a fun trope, and Arias definitely does it justice with the chemistry between Lola and Carmen. The plot itself was a bit odd, especially in the way everything was resolved, but their relationship was fun to read.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f4a4a537-1111-49a0-8fd2-52a69b9fbfd1">Relinquishing Control</a> was my least favourite of the three, but this was mainly because the plot and especially the ending felt the weakest. Professor Reyes, however, might be my favourite character within all three of these books (although she did spoil Carmilla for me so idk).</p>

<p>by <a href="">Sandra Cisneros</a> — 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌖:</p>
<p>Written as a series of auto-fiction vignettes inspired by Cisneros&rsquo;s early life, The House on Mango Street is a book which I think completes the totality of its vision in a way that not many others do. Cisneros writes in the introduction, which is more explicitly autobiographical than the rest of the text,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>She [herself] thinks stories are about beauty. Beauty that is there to be admired by anyone, like a herd of clouds grazing overhead. She thinks people who are busy working for a living deserve beautiful little stories, because they don&rsquo;t have much time and are tired. She has in mind a book that can be opened at any page and will still make sense to the reader who doesn&rsquo;t know what came before or comes after.</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and The House on Mango Street is exactly this. Across a series of incredibly brief vignettes, some not even one page long, Cisneros demonstrates an amazing control of form in the way she writes and conveys beauty and not just in an ultimately aesthetic sense but also in a sense that is really intrinsic to human experience - as so much of the book is about. The chapters are funny, sad, somewhat nostalgic, and touching in so many ways. Alongside these broader experiences of youth a lot of The House on Mango Street is about the experience of growing up as a young Latina girl within Chicago, and Cisneros gives a lovely insight into Esperanza&rsquo;s experiences and the world around her. Highly, highly recommended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We come from Black, white, Latino communities. We are men and we are women. What we have in common is our sense that art should serve our communities. Together we publish an anthology &hellip; organize monthly art events at my brother Keek&rsquo;s apartment &hellip; We do this with no capital except our valuable time. We do this because the world we live in is a house on fire and the people we love are burning.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>She looked out the window her whole life, the way so many women sit their sadness on an elbow.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw a really nice piece a month-ish ago from someone on TikTok who I now forget the identity of about the necessity of being in community with people we dislike, ranging from mild dislike to people who genuinely hate us (us as in us as queer people), and the necessity of ensuring that in actually striving towards improving society for everyone as leftists it is important we think about the fact that we need to improve society for <em>everyone</em>. Writing now about Cash&rsquo;s efforts to maintain Ridley Falls&rsquo; identity while it is a place with an at least semi-notable portion of the population who is deeply homophobic reminds me of it and I really like Mejia&rsquo;s writing for that fact. Their politics, from what I see across their Instagram and some other pieces written about them, come across really nicely within the book in this example and in so many other places and I really value their writing for that.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
