This month was somewhat of an attempt at finishing off a few series that I&rsquo;ve had on the backburner for a while, and starting that off The Oleander Sword (sequel to The Jasmine Throne) did not disappoint at all. Almost every aspect of this book built amazingly off the first, the pacing was great and didn&rsquo;t lose any tension despite being a &ldquo;middle book&rdquo; of a duology, and the changes in the ways in which the Ahiranyan people viewed the Yaksa (without giving any major spoilers) set up some amazing tension for the final books. The characters as well really find a lot of strength in this book and the relationship between Priya and Melina being amazingly developed as their characters grew over the course of the book - the absolute <em>yearning</em>. I was going to highlight Bhumika as a character I especially loved in this book, and then I remembered Sima too, and then Aditya and Rao, and then one who is kinda spoilers to discuss, and then I just gave up on highlighting characters. This book left me absolutely desperate for the final book (The Lotus Empire).</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There was a body on the ground. A rider, in Ahiranyi colors. Pale flowers were sprouting from his skin. His cut throat was a garland of ashoka blossoms and oleander, empty of blood.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>by <a href="https://rebeccathorne.net">Rebecca Thorne</a> — 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌘:<br>
The next sequel I wanted to catch up on, A Pirate&rsquo;s Life for Tea was an amazing follow-up to Can&rsquo;t Spell Treason Without Tea. Like the first this book was incredibly cosy and comforting, the romance between Kianthe and Reyna was as before deeply lovely to read, and the incredibly cheesy pirate adventure was just perfect. No notes.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Then she pulled Kianthe close, so their noses were almost touching, so their breaths intermingled — the moment of truth.</em><br>

<p>by Qiu Miaojin, translated by Bonnie Huie — 🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑:<br>
Framed as a collection of the narrator&rsquo;s journals describing her college life and experiences as a lesbian in 1980s Taipei, Notes of a Crocodile was incredibly bold and ambitious but for every bit I loved from it I ultimately found it hard to connect with the characters. I think I might have not been in the right space for the book at the time because on reflection now I remember them vividly, but as a reading experience I unfortunately didn&rsquo;t enjoy it as much. Some parts of the writing were difficult to follow - I think a combination of Miaojin&rsquo;s postmodern writing and the force of translation - and I never quite fully got the scenes discussing the crocodile (especially the final ones).</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Her eyes were suffused with a profound and translucent light, like the ocean gazing at me in silence, as if it were not necessary to speak at all.</em> You don&rsquo;t understand. <em>She thought she understood. And she accepted me. Years later, I realised that had been the whole point.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>by <a href="https://akauthor.com.au">Ambelin Kwaymullina</a>  — 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌘:<br>
A series of incredibly insightful poems written in a style interestingly close to prose, examining the colonial landscape (physical and not) within Australia. Incredibly thought provoking and in its prose-like style provides a lot of clarity into indigenous frameworks for understanding as well as indigenous post-colonialism.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this was a library book and I didn&rsquo;t record any quotes myself, but I did like this one from the opening poem.<br>
<em>&ldquo;You are living on Indigenous lands<br>
swimming in Indigenous waters<br>
looking up at Indigenous skies</em></p>
<p><em>There is no part of this place<br>
that was not<br>
is not<br>
cared for<br>
loved<br>
by an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander nation&rdquo;</em></p>

I really loved Wilsner&rsquo;s other books, but unfortunately this one just wasn&rsquo;t quite as good. That&rsquo;s not at all to say it was bad, though, and for what I picked up on for a fun romance delivered on that very well. Jo and Emma were both great to read together and I think aside from chemistry they also just worked really well as characters. The book tried to touch on some heavier topics, mainly sexual abuse within the film industry, and though it started off really strong and emotionally impactful (the anger I felt on one of the character&rsquo;s behalf aaa) it unfortunately was weakly wrapped up and then kind of forgotten about for the last 1/3 of the book. I didn&rsquo;t note any quotes I really loved(((</p>

<p>by <a href="https://www.fondalee.com">Fonda Lee</a> — 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗:<br>
The next venture in my finishing fantasy series I hadn&rsquo;t got back around to binge and god was this one amazing too (maybe I should finish more of the series I like oops). The expansion in scope from the first book&rsquo;s tight, noir-esque gang novel seems like a risk in retrospect but worked so well that never once did I question it while reading - and this is definitely a testament to Lee&rsquo;s vibrant and compelling worldbuilding. In particular, the exploration of the intersection between Kekonese and other international cultures (especially Espenian) on the level of individual characters (especially Anden) as well as in the broader themes and plot arcs was incredible.</p>
<p>I really loved the brief time that Wen got in the first book and seeing more of her here was incredible, she&rsquo;s definitely a favourite character of mine within a cast of characters all of whom I engaged so deeply with (also omg her arc through this book😭). Lee&rsquo;s martial arts experience also definitely came through in this book, and like in the first the jade power system was so compelling to read in every way; the intricacies of it within the Jade disciplines, the actual fight scenes themselves, and then the ways in which the jade disciplines influence Kekonese culture (and also the world broadly) through so many levels are all very well thought out and executed.</p>
<p><em>&quot;&lsquo;The clan is my blood and the pillar is my master,&rsquo; she whispered. &lsquo;I have a lot of regrets in life, but those oaths aren&rsquo;t one of them.&rsquo;&quot;</em></p>

<p>by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thejjarias/?hl=en">J. J. Arias</a> — 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑:<br>
An enemies-to-lovers romcom centred around the two eldest daughters each set to take over their families&rsquo; rival pastry businesses, Guava Flavored Lies was just so much fun. The rivalry and chemistry between Sylvie and Lauren was really compelling, and their interactions always just brought so much life to the page. Some of the broader plot was a bit less compelling, and the side characters a bit lacking, but just good fun and exactly what I wanted to read at the time.</p>
<p>My favourite quote from this is spoilers sorry 🙃</p>

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say much more without big spoilers with this being the third in a trilogy, but oh my god - amazing. The clan is my blood and the pillar is its master.</p>
<p><em>&quot;&lsquo;The shit I&rsquo;ve seen, keke. I could tell you some stories,&rsquo; the driver said. &lsquo;Stories about the clan.&quot;<br>

<p>by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sayaka_murata_/?hl=en">Sayaka Murata</a>, translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori  — 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑:<br>
What the fuck. I picked this up right after the emotional turmoil of Jade Legacy and was looking for something shorter, quirky, and just something I could read through. It book was nothing that I was expecting at all, and after the emotional turmoil of the first two chapters I was committed to straight up DNF-ing it - but then I just kept having an itch to go back and read more. In the morning and on the bus to work I got most of the way through the second chapter and put it down, but by the afternoon on the bus home from work I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself picking it back up.</p>
<p>This book was incredibly confronting and visceral, but used that perspective to drive home some really compelling thoughts and perspective on the way that society is structured and the expectations of behaviour placed on those of us within it - while also being a profoundly interesting exploration of trauma and grief. This second bit is where the book fell a little bit flat, and I felt that there was a little bit missing in how it handled these topics - especially towards the ending of the book - but overall it was excellent.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;My town was a collection of nests, a factory for manufacturing babies. I was a tool for the town&rsquo;s good, in two senses.</em><br>
<em>Firstly, I had to study hard to become a work tool.</em><br>
<em>Secondly, I had to be a good girl, so that I could become a reproductive organ for the town.</em><br>
<em>I would probably be a failure on both counts, I thought</em>&rdquo;</p>

After reading and enjoying Guava Flavored Lies so much I was really hoping to enjoy more from J. J. Arias, and unfortunately this just wasn&rsquo;t as good. Honestly, in trying to write this I realised I didn&rsquo;t even remember reading the book and had to go double check the synopsis. The characters were cute together and there were some good scenes (after I jogged my memory), but it just wasn&rsquo;t nearly as fun or mainly compelling as Guava Flavored Lies. Also - holy shit the naming for this series is awful like come on surely we could have done better than &ldquo;Goode Girl&rdquo; because they went to an all-girl&rsquo;s college called Goode come on. It also makes it really hard to find this book because Storygraph just decides</p>

<p>by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maggiethrash/?hl=en">Maggie Thrash</a> — 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑:<br>
This book was amazing, and I&rsquo;m so keen to read more of Thrash&rsquo;s writing. Everything about the setting, plot, and characters so amazing built together and also shaped this book in the kind of &ldquo;women doing insane things&rdquo; genre - with books like Bunny, Earthlings, and My Sister, the Serial Killer (and many others these are just a few I remember rn there are better examples lol) - in such a realistic and compelling way. The hysteria of the satanic panic was built so well, and I felt so much for all of the characters throughout. The ending was really well done too and carried the emotional weight of the book through to a really good conclusion, but unfortunately the second kind of major arc of this book before the conclusion fell a bit flat compared to the first. I&rsquo;ve got complicated feelings here because I love it for what it did, and the character growth and exploration through it was so good (especially Gwen - it&rsquo;s really really nice to see trans girls in stories that aren&rsquo;t about transitioning or even really them, she just is an important trans character), but in execution it just didn&rsquo;t feel as strong as the amazing first act. I am so so excited to read more from Thrash.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;All I can say is that freedom’s a feeling I’ll never know: to be so beautiful you terrify the world, daring it to annihilate you. Unlike me, whose only hope is to survive.&rdquo;</em></p>

I kinda get monster romance now I think? It&rsquo;s not really a subgenre I had read much of but this was really good, the characters fun and so hard not to care for, and the plot was surprisingly compelling and emotional.</p>

<p>by Clarice Lispector, translated by Alison Entrekin — 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌖:<br>
Holy shit. This book was like a physical force, and I haven&rsquo;t read anything at all like it before. Lispector&rsquo;s prose, and the way in which she uses it to explore the vivid workings of Joanna&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings across some of the stages of her life, is absolutely incredible. The book itself is a series of vignettes across Joanna&rsquo;s life, with a few chapters from the perspective of other people within her life - but even having read it I couldn&rsquo;t give a good summary to the breadth of topics it gives consideration. The only reason really that I don&rsquo;t consider the book a complete 10/10, is that in all of that I feel like I absolutely wasn&rsquo;t able to grasp the totality of the work - if I ever get around to re-reading it (which I would love to, it&rsquo;s an incredibly compelling book) it will likely become a perfect 10.</p>

A fast paced and hilarious action-comedy about an amnesiac, undead, assassin sent to &ldquo;ship&rdquo; someone who reminds her all too much of a past she was supposed to have forgotten. Every bit of this book just works so smoothly, the premise is punchy and compelling, the worldbuilding is interesting, fun, and the book being set on the night of a festival provides a great crash-course insight into the cultures present, and Eveen + the rest of the cast (kinda spoilers to detail exactly who) play off each other incredibly well. The book and world are just so much fun to read through and I tore through it all in less than a day (it&rsquo;s also quite short).</p>
<p><em>&quot;&lsquo;Eviscerator?&rsquo; The girl&rsquo;s jaw went slack. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re called the</em> Eviscerator?&rsquo;<br>
<em>Eveen rolled her eyes. &lsquo;It was just the once.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>by Brandon Sanderson — 🌕🌕🌕🌖🌑:<br>
This book was honestly a bit of a letdown, it definitely felt like a big step down from Sanderson&rsquo;s other work. I think the short-form style of the work highlighted some of the feelings I&rsquo;ve had about his longer works - his worldbuilding, plot, and characterisation are incredibly strong but sometimes it feel like they lack a central point, or message, or emotional resonance that I find in similar fantasy works (The Green Bone Saga and The Burning Kingdom Trilogy from this month, or one of my absolute favourites The Radiant Emperor Duology). Shortened down in a form that didn&rsquo;t give quite as much worldbuilding, nowhere near as rich or detailed a plot, and stripped down character building/growth, Edgedancer was unfortunately disappointing.</p>
<p>Lift was a character I liked when she appeared previously, but as the focal character for a whole book her outlook grated a bit in a minor way in the way she treats Wyndle, and in a major way in the way in which she punches down against marginalised groups. Specifically, there are some pretty transphobic comments made regarding a woman with a potentially masculine facial structure (which is pretty awful and notably so since this is the first mention of transgender people existing in Roshar afaik) that really felt off. Notably, it&rsquo;s a distinct choice for Sanderson to choose to replicate the same structures of patriarchal oppression that would laugh at women who appear too masculine and in a world so distinct from our own it feels disappointing that Sanderson didn&rsquo;t consider the impacts of these kinds of subconscious biases.</p>
<p>I am led to believe that there is better representation of a(?) trans character in the later books, and Sanderson is outwardly supportive, but these kinds of biases are just as important to consider. Alongside this there are a number of disparaging comments made about a woman&rsquo;s weight which again carry me along the same train of thought - Sanderson chose, consciously or not, to include these structures of oppression within his world despite how distinct it is from our own, and including them solely for the purpose of punching down with some bad jokes is just icky. I probably won&rsquo;t discuss any of his other books in detail, if I read them at all.</p>
