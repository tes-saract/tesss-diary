      <description>Every time I read a book written before like the 1960s I am kind of always surprised by how funny they are and that probably says a lot about me as a person. Especially this and Emma (by Jane Austen) are both some of the funniest books I have read in such a long time that at this point I probably shouldn&#39;t be shocked. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a huge number of particularly deep or analyticaly thoughts about the book, but it was hilariously and beautifully written - I adored the four main characters who were all deeply interesting and unique, especially of these Lotte and Lady Charlotte were probably my two favourite characters in the text.</description>
