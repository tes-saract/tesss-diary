      <description>Just full spoilers in this one, it&amp;rsquo;s too hard to talk about the world without them. This is also a book that my thoughts about will definitely likely change once the sequel comes out - there was a lot of time spent on worldbuilding, mystery, and characterisation that was done really interestingly but didn&amp;rsquo;t pay out in this book and I&amp;rsquo;m not yet certain if I enjoyed that fully or not.</description>

      <description>One of many queer romance novels I&amp;rsquo;ve read recently, but the one I felt like writing about, The Goode Governor (awful name aside like come on) actually surprised me a lot. Centrally in portraying two highly intelligent and motivated queer women which is something that really I don&amp;rsquo;t see much in any romance novels. Reflecting on this, it feels like a lot of the time there is one smart/motivated character in the couple and the other it there to play a foil to them.</description>
