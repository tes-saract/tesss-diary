      <description>The third book which I&amp;rsquo;ve rated 10/10 with sun in its title (see: She Who Became the Sun, Klara and the Sun); Sunburn is a heart wrenching exploration of childhood and early adulthood in a deeply traditional, rural Irish upbringing. There is so much to talk about from this book and I adored it deeply, but something about it just made me really want to write about the way it uses the environment.</description>
