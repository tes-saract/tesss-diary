      <description>From start to finish, the environment in Sunburn is perhaps more of an expression and representation of Lucy&amp;rsquo;s feelings and emotions than anything else we see from her. And this is not to say that we do not get a deep exploration of her thoughts and feelings throughout the text, but rather that the imagery of her rural environment, especially the titular sun, is so importantly a part of her thoughts and feelings that it is impossible to separate the two.</description>
