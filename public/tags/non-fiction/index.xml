      <description>&amp;ldquo;Each day I live as if I am already dead, and I tell you what I would like for you to do. When I am dead - I say it that way because of the things I know, I do not expect to live long enough to read this book in its finished form - I want you to watch and see if I&amp;rsquo;m not right in what I say: that the white man, in his press, is going to identify me with &amp;lsquo;hate&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Being completely upfront here this is not going to be the most detailed reflection on Wittig&amp;rsquo;s essays, it took me a bit to finish this whole collection and I didn&amp;rsquo;t think to make notes or start this diary until I was a few months past finishing the earlier ones. Unfortunately, as well, the later essays in the collection did lose me somewhat as they begin to discuss a lot more of the literary craft and specifically with reference to some other authors at the time as well as Wittig&amp;rsquo;s own work in a way that I just did not have the background to understand.</description>
