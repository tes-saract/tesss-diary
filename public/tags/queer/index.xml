      <description>To anyone thinking if they should read this (I vote yes), go read the synopsis, it perfectly conveys the what and why of reading this. In fact, if you want you could put this down (my writing is a lot worse than Seolyeon&amp;rsquo;s, and Anton Hur&amp;rsquo;s translation) and go finish AMGR first - it&amp;rsquo;s quite short.&#xA;A brief note, I&amp;rsquo;m not the most into the magical girl genre as a whole really, I&amp;rsquo;d probably consider myself more involved than like an average person but considering I write a bit here about the genre&amp;rsquo;s history I want to preface that I might be off on some of these points.</description>

      <description>One of many queer romance novels I&amp;rsquo;ve read recently, but the one I felt like writing about, The Goode Governor (awful name aside like come on) actually surprised me a lot. Centrally in portraying two highly intelligent and motivated queer women which is something that really I don&amp;rsquo;t see much in any romance novels. Reflecting on this, it feels like a lot of the time there is one smart/motivated character in the couple and the other it there to play a foil to them.</description>

      <description>Being completely upfront here this is not going to be the most detailed reflection on Wittig&amp;rsquo;s essays, it took me a bit to finish this whole collection and I didn&amp;rsquo;t think to make notes or start this diary until I was a few months past finishing the earlier ones. Unfortunately, as well, the later essays in the collection did lose me somewhat as they begin to discuss a lot more of the literary craft and specifically with reference to some other authors at the time as well as Wittig&amp;rsquo;s own work in a way that I just did not have the background to understand.</description>

      <description>From start to finish, the environment in Sunburn is perhaps more of an expression and representation of Lucy&amp;rsquo;s feelings and emotions than anything else we see from her. And this is not to say that we do not get a deep exploration of her thoughts and feelings throughout the text, but rather that the imagery of her rural environment, especially the titular sun, is so importantly a part of her thoughts and feelings that it is impossible to separate the two.</description>
