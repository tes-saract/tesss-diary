To anyone thinking if they should read this (I vote yes), go read the [synopsis](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/4debd23a-31bc-41e1-a916-8be2c6a61cfe), it perfectly conveys the what and why of reading this. In fact, if you want you could put this down (my writing is a lot worse than Seolyeon's, and Anton Hur's translation) and go finish <abbr title="A Magical Girl Retires">AMGR</abbr> first - it's quite short.

A brief note, I'm not the most into the magical girl genre as a whole really, I'd probably consider myself more involved than like an average person but considering I write a bit here about the genre's history I want to preface that I might be off on some of these points. A lot of this is just comparing A Magical Girl Retires to my understanding of the genre but if anyone has more thoughts feel free to let me know.

That out of the way, I think it's really interesting to consider this book within the framework of the genre's conventions, in the way in which it does a really amazing job of incorporating very modern concerns (climate change, debt, what success means in our capitalist hellscape, misogyny). 

Considering the roots of the magical girl genre - in shōjo manga - and the conventions it developed which typically focused around around femininity and its relationship to power, friendships and relationships, etc., these thematic foci seem like they should feel out of place. Despite this, however, AMGR does an amazing job of sticking faithfully to the genre in its execution of these themes.

One of the central pieces of this, I believe, is in the justification behind the fact that magical girls in the universe are all, well, girls (and women - as the book makes a point of they can be any age).


Keeping many staples of the genre - flashy transformation sequences and costumes, women-centred answers to world-ending threats, and a plot arc that I won't spoil but I think stays true to the genre - A Magical Girl Retires feels like a piece of magical girl media that grew alongside its audience, and the MCs central struggles throughout the novella reflect this perfectly.

In doing so, I think it does an amazing job of building from a genre that in recent years has seen a lot more parody and deconstruction than work staying within the conventions (Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Kill la Kill, etc), while also developing that genre beyond the shōjo audience. 

 I think, most importantly to this, through and through AMGR *feels* like a magical girl text - the genre's conventions in structure and form are carried through faithfully just now we have grown up and are worried about slightly different things.

## Random Notes

Yay the small hints of romance throughout were so cute.

Shoutout to the artist, [Kim Sanho](https://www.instagram.com/sanhomaydraw/?hl=en), for her work on the cover and chapter arts. They are all gorgeous and it made me so happy to see the chapter art.

Also shoutout to the person on goodreads who wrote that the MC is two years late for Austen's “i’m 27 years old, i’ve no money and no prospects. i’m already a burden to my parents and i’m frightened” quote. (In writing this I found out that Austen never actually wrote this line, and it's just from the 2005 movie, oops).
