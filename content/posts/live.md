We're finally live!!

I'm really not great at this whole coding thing so god it took me a lot of googling but we finally got here and I have a real website! I hit a bit of a writing block while I tried to get this to work hence the burst of posts written like two weeks ago and then nothing until now, but I've got more to write about books and other stuff over the next few days!

AAAAAAAAA

Also had a really productive day working on R coding today and things that weren't working last week finally clicked into place, I guess today is just a lucky day for my software development skills hehe
