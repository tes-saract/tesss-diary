One of many queer romance novels I've read recently, but the one I felt like writing about, The Goode Governor (awful name aside like come on) actually surprised me a lot. Centrally in portraying two highly intelligent and motivated queer women which is something that really I don't see much in any romance novels. Reflecting on this, it feels like a lot of the time there is one smart/motivated character in the couple and the other it there to play a foil to them. Here, however, Mila and George's dynamic works so well because of how similar they both are in intelligence and drive - and instead some of the differences in their relationship come from their conflicting political views, especially their initial - very strong - dislike of each other. (Specifically with them being in politics I really enjoyed this compared to the unchallenged neolib-ness of Those Who Wait)

Unfortunately this dynamic isn't really kept up throughout the book, and I think some of the writing does let it down a bit. There is one scene in particular when they are both exercising together that just felt like it progressed way too quickly, and I think the final act of the book did lose a lot of its strength because of this. Some of the earliest scenes in the book are my favourites and that's not really something I can say about many books at all to be honest. Though their u-hauling near the end of the book was hilarious and super cute.
