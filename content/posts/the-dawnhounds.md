> Just full spoilers in this one, it's too hard to talk about the world without them. This is also a book that my thoughts about will definitely likely change once the sequel comes out - there was a lot of time spent on worldbuilding, mystery, and characterisation that was done really interestingly but didn't pay out in this book and I'm not yet certain if I enjoyed that fully or not.

Coming out of the gate, the worldbuilding in The Dawnhounds is so much fun to read, and especially the dynamics of its gods/magic system and Yat's interactions with it. The scene when Yat just straight up killed herself trying to jump back to Hainak was great, and alongside the brief chapters from the perspective of the gods(?) and in the context of the rest of the book these aspects of the magic were so interestingly established. Some of the mystery-ness to this whole setup did unfortunately make it feel a bit harder to follow/some chapters felt a bit disconnected (e.g. Sibbi's visit to Dawgar), and it did feel a bit too much like a setup to a sequel.

The romance was also not the most compelling, with the whole reveal at the end feeling a little bit odd. They were cute together once it happened, though, and I am excited to see their interactions in the sequel.
