title: I find another book written before the 1960s and shock myself by enjoying it

Every time I read a book written before like the 1960s I am kind of always surprised by how funny they are and that probably says a lot about me as a person. Especially this and Emma (by Jane Austen) are both some of the funniest books I have read in such a long time that at this point I probably shouldn't be shocked.

I don't have a huge number of particularly deep or analyticaly thoughts about the book, but it was hilariously and beautifully written - I adored the four main characters who were all deeply interesting and unique, especially of these Lotte and Lady Charlotte were probably my two favourite characters in the text. To be particular about the writing, the way in which the 'magic' of San Salvatore was conveyed through the imagery and character growth (especially Lotte her persistent belief in the magic and her visions are one of my favourite parts of her) over the course of the text made it just such a pleasure to read. The humour is dry and very well done too in a way that reminds me a huge amount of Austen's writing, and the writing also makes me wonder if Von Arnim had ADHD because I know I like to use too much punctuation in one sentence because of it (probably) and she definitely does the same in this book (in the best way, that is; I really enjoy this kind of writing).

Thematically the book does unfortunately fall a little bit flat, despite the characters breaks from the world they are all ultimately inspired by their trips to return and function as expected by society - indeed in some ways, for Lady Charlotte especially, they never even truly get to break from the world (I do think that for as much as I adored her character her narrative arc definitely feels the weakest). I'm not completely sure how this makes me feel about the book - it's nice to know that heterosexual people can have functioning marriages I guess - but it does mean that a lot of the text is instead held up for me by its writing and humour rather than a particular message.

I think this reversion to the norm does unfortunately make the ending weaker too beyond the thematic components; most of the male characters were less fleshed out and interesting, especially compared to the four main women, and thus the ways in which the general bend of the narrative arcs in this book trend back towards them just makes the overall plot weak.

Despite all of that, I just enjoyed so much of this book too much to not recommend it. Perhaps that's just a coincidence or alignment of my sense of humour with the author's but I'm so willing to overlook the ways in which the book fell flat because the things it does well it does incredibly well.

[^2]: This was such an out of place moment I really felt like I had just stumbled onto like a queer romance novel for a second?? It was also where we learnt their first names implying they were shared with each other off-screen? slightly gay. Someone should really make a queer retelling of this story I feel like it is absolutely ripe for it. (I absolutely headcanon Lady Caroline as a lesbian too it just makes too much sense)
