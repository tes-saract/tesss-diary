Every time I read a book written before the 20th century I am kind of always surprised by how funny they are and that probably says a lot about me as a person. Especially this and Emma (by Jane Austen) are both some of the funniest books I have read in such a long time that at this point I probably shouldn't be shocked.

I don't have a huge number of thoughts about the book, but it was hilariously and beautifully written - I adored the four main characters who were all deeply interesting and unique, especially of these Lotte and Lady Charlotte were probably my two favourite characters in the text. To be particular about the writing, the way in which the 'magic' of San Salvatore was conveyed through the imagery and character growth (especially Lotte her persistent belief in the magic and her visions are one of my favourite parts of her) over the course of the text made it just such a pleasure to read. The humour is dry and very well done too in a way that reminds me a huge amount of Austen's writing, and the writing also makes me wonder if Von Arnim had ADHD because I know I like to use too much punctuation in one sentence because of it and she definitely does the same in this book (in the best way, that is; I really enjoy this kind of writing).

Thematically the book does unfortunately fall a little bit flat, despite the characters breaks from the world they are all ultimately inspired by their trips to return and function as expected by society - indeed in some ways, for Lady Charlotte especially, they never even truly get to break from the world (I do think, as much as I adored her character and especially friendship with Lotte). This is not a hugely like make or break criticism - it's nice to know that heterosexual people can have functioning marriages I guess - but it does mean that a lot of the text is instead held up for me by its writing and humour rather than a particular message.

I think this does unfortunately make the ending a bit weaker too beyond the thematic components - the male characters were definitely less fleshed out and less interesting in a way that really meant every scene revolved around the four women. This wasn't necessarily bad, but definitely made me wonder if the book would have been even better if the men had never arrived.

[^2]: This was such an out of place moment I really felt like I had just stumbled onto like a queer romance novel for a second?? It was also where we learnt their first names implying they were shared with each other off-screen? slightly gay. Someone should really make a queer retelling of this story I feel like it is absolutely ripe for it. (I absolutely headcanon Lady Caroline as a lesbian too, another victim of comphet üòû)
