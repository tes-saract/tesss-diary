 >Sylvia Plath - *A Birthday Present*

In reading The Bell Jar and then A Birthday Present - which was written approx. a year after the first completed manuscript of The Bell Jar - there seems at least to me to be this thematic through line of the veil, the border, or indeed the titular bell jar. This separation of self from the functioning of the outside world through which Plath explores (centrally) the theme of isolation in both this poem and novel.

There's a huge amount that could be said about The Bell Jar, but I'm queer so I'm going to talk about existing outside the patriarchy, and more specifically the mechanisms through which the patriarchy purposely obscures the possibilities of this existence.

We see this process from the very beginning of the book - even so much as to  in the foreword of the version I read (which was interesting but I'm not going to talk about since it wasn't Plath's work)[^1] From there the opening line that plunges into Esther's
