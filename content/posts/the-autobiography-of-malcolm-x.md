When I *am* dead - I say it that way because of the things I *know*, I do not expect to live long enough to read this book in its finished form - I want you to watch and see if I'm not right in what I say: that the white man, in his press, is going to identify me with 'hate'...

When a book's blurb starts with "One of TIME magazine's ten most important nonfiction books of the twentieth century", I feel compelled to try and answer that question from my own perspective (it's basically blurb clickbait tbh). Is this one of the best books I have read this year, indeed based on my reading stats there are 20 books and counting I reviewed higher at the time of writing. But of those 20, I don't think many have been as valuable to me in a broader sense[^1] - this is absolutely a book that gives a lot to think about and in that sense yeah it is probably one of the ten most important nonfiction books of the twentieth century. Speaking in terms of its impact and importance socially, rather than personally to me, it absolutely is. This book is such an insightful exploration of an incredibly important figure in an incredibly important period of history, that it will probably be hard to unseat.

[^1]: By my counting I would say these are [This Has Always Been a War: the Radicalisation of a Working Class Queer](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/73c83861-4512-47ba-96dd-b168a0a98ccd) by Lori Fox, [No Name in the Street](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/aef8272f-65fe-4306-9bea-1cb3a5bd76ba) and [The Fire Next Time](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9ef6bf14-d9f8-4cd1-97bb-43f541a1c26a) by James Baldwin, [Fl√®che](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2d011b2e-8103-4255-b58a-c68a8762380d) by Mary Jean Chan, and [Chain-Gang All-Stars](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/eae402b7-99c9-4f03-8762-b3decef359f8) by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah. These books are all amazing amazing pieces of writing which I think impacted the way I view the world just as or more deeply, and are also ones I enjoyed wholistically more than The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Especially Chain-Gang All-Stars that book is a masterpiece.

Really so much of this book, for me, was in learning and understanding - especially especially about Malcolm X (a.k.a. El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz)'s relationship to his Islamic religion and the ways with which it interacted with the civil rights movement through the Nation of Islam and then pan-African movements of which Malcolm X Shabazz was involved shortly before his death. Especially as an agnostic person, reading Malcolm's experiences - primarily of finding religion in prison, as well as during Hajj - REALLY REFLECT MORE, focusing not on my own experiences but what there is to learn from the book

"You know what my life had been. Picking a lock to rob someone's house was the only way my knees had ever been bent before. I had to force myself to bend my knees. And waves of shame and embarrassment would force me back up."




Hayley's impact on the book in keeping a lot of Malcolm's separatist beliefs and dedication to the Nation of Islam - and specifically Elijah Muhammad - during his time with the organisation provides a lot of insight into the development of Malcolm's beliefs
