There's a lot of discourse around this book, which I think considering its content and focus really highlights how well written it is - Yellowface is an amazing book and I think a huge part of that is how it forces its audience into engaging with its themes. Kuang is not at all passive in her representation of themes throughout the book through the ways in which June is blatantly racist from the first chapter to the last, the perversive voyeurism of the omnipresent "audience" and the relationship to authorial identity and "honesty", and the ways in which the publishing industry works to further oppress marginalised writers and audiences. 

I think there is some possibility that the fact that I do engage with a lot of the internet dynamics that this book is exploring might bias me towards engaging more actively with it in turn, but as is I feel that the way Yellowface presents these issues in such a present context makes it very easy for the reader to engage (Though it is quite funny that the book is already dated by referring to Twitter as such and not as X). Importantly, here, I think that engagement with Yellowface does mean examining the ways in which we interact with the dynamics and systems of oppression presented within and this is something that I think really makes it a great book.

My one really important addendum to this is that the way Kuang explores class structure and classism is, unfortunately, really lacking throughout the book. The thumbnail is a bit sensationalised but [withcindy](https://www.instagram.com/readwithcindy/?hl=en) has a great video about the intersection of race and class within the publishing industry that is really worth watching if you're curious. I do think that this does take away somewhat from the message of the book, especially in that it essentially misses the ways in which these systems intersect, and the video below is definitely worth a watch.
